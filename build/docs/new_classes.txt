Player Classes
--------------

Creating a new playerclass within the SDK Template is Very easy, and involves 6 steps!

Step 1: Open sdk_shareddefs.h and sdk_shareddefs.cpp
	(.h) increment the define SDK_NUM_PLAYERCLASSES to reflect the new count of player classes you will have

	(.cpp) modify pszPossiblePlayerModels, and add any player models you'll be using.

	if You're using teams; 
	(.cpp) modify both pszTeamBlueClasses, and pszRedBlueClasses to add your new player class.
	if you're not using teams:
	(.cpp) modify pszPlayerClasses and add your new player class.


Step 2: create a new playerclass script for your new class. If you're using teams, you'll need a playerclass_blue_classX.txt file and a playerclass_red_classX.txt file, if you're not you only need a new playerclass_pc_classX.txt
Step 3: create new .res file's for your new classes inside the "classes" folder - This is for the player class screen, where it shows the information for the class.
Step 4: modify resource\ui\classmenu_XXX.res to add new buttons to select your new classes.
Step 5: modify your language.txt file to add any new localization strings (ie: descriptions) you're using.
Step 6: Compile your mod, load it up, and if everything was successful you should have a new class to choose!

r.cpp to your new weapon.

Have fun!
